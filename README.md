Let the teamwork make the dream work!

My name is John Andrew Wilson and I have over ten years experience in web design, branding, print design, UI and UX design. I began my education in Architecture and IT teaching and then decided to change career after really enjoying the creative aspects of IT during my teaching experience. I combine my art and design background with my teaching and passion for computing to hopefully become the best I possibly can whilst helping others around me do the same.

I forgot to add a comment before commiting! So this is a new line to explain that I missed it.
